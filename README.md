# Scientific-Image-Forgery-in-BioMedical-
A 4-stage deep learning pipeline for detecting forged biomedical images. Uses a triple-branch CNN (RGB + SRM noise + Fourier frequency) with a modified U-Net for pixel-level forgery segmentation and a PPO-based RL agent that learns investigative priors. Trained on synthetic forgeries, benchmarked against ResNet, EfficientNet &amp; ViT.
